				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>We've all seen the infamous notes app apology from one celebrity or another. 
					Well, with the apology generator, now you can generate your own! 
					I wanted to create a text generator where it was feasible for the outputs to sound similar. 
					I thought of notes app apologies because of the running internet joke that they're all the same.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Using the bad-quests template, I made my own text template that that randomly calls from the filler categories. 
					I also changed out all of the filler categories, and made them longer than just a single word for more variety.
					I also implemented a name inputting feature, using an input box and the "New apology!" button to generate an apology 
					with the inputted name. The date and time shown at the top, which I added to replicate the notes app, 
					is courtesy to a function made by ChatGPT that grabs the current dateTime from the user and formats it into readable text.
					Finally, I also did a bit of CSS styling so that it looks more similar to the what the Apple Notes app looks like, 
					the popular choice for notes app apologies.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>It was really fun making this generator! While the template and fillers were easy enough to manipulate, 
					the hard part came in with adding the name input, since I was having a bit of trouble initially getting the text to update with input.
					I also had a bit of trouble with CSS styling, simply because I'm not too familiar with it, but I was able to fix both problems
					by consulting ChatGPT. Overall, I'm really pleased by both the aesthetic and content of my final product.

				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>I wanted to create the feelin of a pixelly world, contrasted with round bubbles on the water. 
					Also, the bubbles remind me of bubble wrap and stress relief.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>I mostly just changed the colors and the tile clicking functionality so that it now displays bubbles
					instead of small spheres.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>To be honest, I struggled with creativity for this assignment due to stress from other classes, but I was 
					satisfied with the “bubbles” I created in the small pools of water. It also took quite a while for me to 
					really understand how the base code worked, but once I figured it out, the process became a lot easier.

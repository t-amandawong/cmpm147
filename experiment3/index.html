				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>In this experiment, I made an overworld and dungeon generator using tiling and autotiling. The goal was to make some simple, realistic worlds that had a bit of movement for the "live" feeling. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>To make the dungeon, I started by I choosing a wall tile set, and a floor tile set. I made a generateRooms function, which generates a random number of dungeon rooms (this function generates the lakes in the overworld generator). I implemented autotiling for the corners and walls of the dungeon rooms by following the tutorial. Finally, to make both generators interesting, I added movement for the tiles based on the current frameCount.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I really enjoyed working on this project. While the auto tiling was a bit of a challenge, it was a welcome one, and it was really exciting when I finally got it working how I wanted to. A brief low I had was trying to get the canvases to both display, but after a bit of trial and error, I was able to get it done easily. I feel good about my final product, especially because this was something so new to me.
